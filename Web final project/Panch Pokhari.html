            <h1 id="history">History of Panch Pokhari</h1>
     
     <p>The history of Panch Pokhari dates back to about 2400 years ago. There was a hunter called <b>Bumba Ruwa Waiba</b>. One day he went hunting and reached Panch Pokhari. Meanwhile, at the same time, he saw Lord Shiva planting paddy in the snowy field. Waiba was shocked when he found someone planting paddy in the snowy field. After that, Waiba went near the Lord Shiva and when he was about to reach the place where he was planting paddy, Lord Shiva suddenly disappeared. Lord Shiva disappeared exactly at the place where today lies the famous temple.
     <br>
        Still, there is a belief that some people see the <b>“Halo”(plough)</b> and <b>“Juwa”(beam)</b> that is used to plough or dig the field below the temple. Meanwhile, there is an outlet of the pond as a waterfall. Some people believe that they can see the Halo and Juwa near the waterfall. And, Hunter Waiba believed that he saw Lord Shiva and he did not have anything to offer. He had a hunter dog and there was a bell on the neck of the dog. He offered the bell at the temple and this can be still seen by the visitors and pilgrims who visit the temple.</p>
