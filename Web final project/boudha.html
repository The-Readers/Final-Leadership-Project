      </p>
      
      <p>
        <b>Boudhanath</b> is often considered the center of Tibetan culture in Kathmandu. The architecture of <b>Swayambhunath</b> and Boudha Stupa is somehow similar to see. Every day thousands of visitors walk around the stupa. We can see the pilgrims spinning the holy wheels and chanting mantras. There is a belief that the stupa is from the 14th century. When you visit the place, you feel that Boudha is not just a religious site, but also a cultural hub. This is because the area around the stupa is home to many monasteries and meditation centers.

       <h1 id="mythology">Mythology on the formation of <b>Boudha Stupa</b></h1>

      <p>According to the history of Nepal, where today <b>Narayanhiti Palace</b> is, was the palace of <b>King Vikramaditya</b>. This was during the Lichhavi period. King Vikramaditya instructed a Dhunge Dhara (a tap of stone) in the southern part of the palace. A new Dhunge Dhara was built at the same place king told but this tap produced no water. The king consulted his astrologers when he did not find water in the tap. Those astrologers suggested a human sacrifice of a male candidate having Battis-Lakshanas (thirty-two perfections). The interesting fact about the candidate was only the king himself and his two princes were suitable candidates. Eventually, the king decided to sacrifice himself to bring water to the stone tap. According to <b>local mythology</b>, the sacrifice was done by one of his sons.</p>

       <p>At the time of sacrifice king’s head flew off. Moreover, his head landed at the nearby <b>Sankhu Bajrayogini Temple</b>. The prince went to the top of Bajrayogini and cast off a chicken. At the time, the prince also decided to construct a stupa where it landed. Certainly, the chicken landed exactly where Boudhanath Stupa currently stands. The place was named Khasti because the people at that time were managing to survive the drought by collecting droplets of water. Later, His Majesty’s Government of Nepal renamed the place Boudhanath from Khasti to better reflect the Hinduism of that Hindu nation.</p>   

     <h1 id="history">History</h1>
     
     <p>History says that Boudhanath was founded by the Nepalese <b>Licchavi King Sivadeva</b>. Although, other Nepalese records take it to King Manadeva. Moreover, Tibetan sources claim the bones of King Aṃshuvarma at the stupa. During the Licchavi period, Boudha was an important center for Buddhists. Similarly, many significant religious sites and monuments were built in the country. Boudhanath Stupa was one of them. It was a large, dome-shaped structure. During the Licchavi period also, it was one of the most important Buddhist pilgrimage sites in the world.</p>
     
     <br><p>Moreover, the Licchavi rulers of Boudha were famous for the arts, and many important works and development in the sector of art and literature took place during this time. However, during the Licchavi period, neighboring kingdoms invaded the region frequently. Despite these challenges, the Licchavi period is a time of great prosperity and cultural development in the history of Boudha. The Licchavi period in the history of Boudha refers to a time when the Licchavi dynasty ruled over the region of Boudha.</p>
     
     <br><p>Discussing the <b>Tibetan history</b> of Boudha is close to the history of Buddhism in Tibet. Likewise, Boudha is an important center of <b>Tibetan Buddhism</b>. Similarly, this place has been a destination for Tibetan pilgrims for centuries. King Songtsen Gampo commissioned the construction of several Buddhist temples and monasteries in Tibet and neighboring regions, including Boudha. One of the most significant of these is the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa, which is similar to Boudha in Nepal. Tibetan Buddhism in Boudha continued to grow over the centuries. Likewise, many important Tibetan Buddhist masters traveled to Nepal to teach and spread the Dharma.

        In more recent times, Boudha has become an important center of Tibetan exile culture. This is because many Tibetans fled to Nepal after the Chinese occupation of Tibet in 1950. To this day, Boudha is home to many Tibetan refugees and several important Tibetan Buddhist pilgrims. Correspondingly, Boudha remains a significant destination for Tibetan pilgrims and visitors from around the world.</p>
           
           <h1 id="architecture">Architecture and Cultural Significance of Boudha</h1>
           </br>
           <p>The <b>architecture of Boudhanath Stupa</b> is a massive dome structure that stands at a height of 36 meters (118 feet). Likewise, there is a large circular path around the stupa, with prayer wheels and small shrines around. The stupa has carvings and decorations, including images of the Lord Buddha and other Buddhist deities. Similarly, the stupa’s base is made of stone and surrounded by prayer flags. People believe these prayer flags carry prayers and blessings on the wind. There is a golden pinnacle at the top of the stupa. Above the dome-shaped structure, there lie the <b>“All-seeing eyes of the Buddha”.</b> There is a belief that these eyes represent the Buddha’s wisdom and compassion. Around the stupa, several monasteries and shops sell traditional Tibetan and Nepalese crafts and souvenirs.

            Certainly, we can see the stupa built on a three-level mandala-style platform. Similarly, there are prayer wheels, prayer flags, and small shrines around the stupa. We can see the huge stupa’s white dome base. Here, the white dome base represents the earth. Similarly, the golden spire represents the air. Likewise, the thirteen rings from the base to the top represent the steps to enlightenment according to the believers.</p>

     <p><b>Boudhanath Stupa</b> is one of the important cultural and spiritual landmarks for Tibetan Buddhists. Boudha is one of the holiest places in Nepal for Buddhists and Hindus as well.
