       <h1 id="mythology">Mythology on the formation of <b>Swayambhunath Temple</b></h1>

      <p>There are many myths and beliefs about the <b>origin of Swayambhunath.</b> But according to tradition, this area has been an important religious site for Hindus and Buddhists for over 2000 years. According to <b style="color:red;">Swayambhu Purana,</b> the Kathmandu Valley was a lake fully covered with water. Manjushri, a renowned personality in Buddhism was the person who drained the water of Kathmandu Valley. History tells us that <b>Manjushri</b> made this Valley a suitable living place.</p>
      
     <p>According to myths, at the time of <b>Manjushri,</b> a large and beautiful lotus grew in the middle of the lake. Manjushri had a vision of human settlement at the lake after the water drained out. So, he cut a gorge at <b>Chovar</b> and drained all the water out. After that, the lotus was transformed into a hill. Likewise, the stupa is exactly at the place where the lotus was. History tells us that the lotus flower had the essence of <b>Lord Buddha</b>, and the site became a sacred pilgrimage site.</p>   

     <h1 id="history">History</h1>
     
     <p>After the formation of the stupa, various religious buildings were constructed on the site over time. These constructions included stupas, temples, and shrines. Besides, the temple and buildings in the temple area were damaged and destroyed many times by earthquakes, fires, and invasions. Although, it was always reconstructed and restored.</p>
     
     <p>Malla Kings of the Kathmandu Valley have a major role in the reconstruction and renovation of the temple area. This was during the 14th century. Likewise, a new stupa was made, and the addition of prayer wheels, and construction of statues as well. With time, Swayambhunath became an important center of Buddhist worship and pilgrimage.</p>
     
     <p>Visitors can find a large number of monkeys living around the areas of the temple. People believe they are holy because Manjushri, the bodhisattva of wisdom and learning, was raising the hill exactly where Swayambhunath Stupa lies today. As Manjushri was supposed to leave his hair short, he made it grow long. On the long air grew many lice. Further, there is a belief that these monkeys are the transformation of the lice of Manjushri.</p>

There is a huge <b>Gajur</b> at the top of the stupa. A circular path surrounds the stupa with spinning wheels. Generally, the path is for believers to walk around the stupa and offer prayers to the god. Usually, this praying is done by walking around the Stupa, spinning the wheels, and chanting <b>Mantras.</b></p>
           
           <p>The base of Swayambhunath Temple contains a pair of eyes. However, people believe the eyes of Buddha are his omnipresence and wisdom. Also, the eyes are painted on all four sides of the holy stupa. Identically, between them, there is a nose-shaped symbol which is beautiful to watch. This symbol represents the Nepalese character for number one. Moreover, above the eyes, there is a third eye in the stupa. This eye symbolizes the wisdom and enlightenment of Buddha.</p>           
           
           <p>There are many other smaller stupas, temples, and monasteries near the temple. Indeed, these are decorated with colorful prayer flags, paintings, and carvings. The main features of the temple are the four pairs of lions. These lions are carved on the stupa’s base and represent strength, power, and courage. Moreover, the lions face four directions – north, south, east, and west. People believe these lions guard the stupa and its treasures.</p>
